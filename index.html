            <h2>Precession of the Equinoxes</h2>
            <p class="off small-text">I recommend reading <a href=#ecliptic>[ecliptic]</a> first</p>
            <p>In astronomy, an equinox is a place on the <span class=popup-link id=ppl-celestial>celestial sphere</span> at which the <span class=popup-link id=ppl-ecliptic>ecliptic</span> intersects the <span class=popup-link id=ppl-celestialequator>celestial equator</span>.</p>
            <p>The Earth's rotational axis determines the celestial equator. Since this axis is tilted, the celestial equator and the ecliptic intersect at an angle of 23.4°.</p>
            <p>( equinoxes are not just a direction in space but <span class=popup-link id=ppl-equinoxmoment>moments</span> )</p>
            <p class=center>. . .</p>
            <p>Due to some <span class=popup-link id=ppl-forces>perturbing forces</span>, the Earth's rotational axis gyrates with a period of about 25,800 years. Thus, the equinoxes move with respect to the celestial sphere. This motion is called <i>precession of the equinoxes</i> or just <i>precession</i>. ( <span class=popup-link id=ppl-precessiongif>animation</span> )</p>
            <p>The precession affects the direction of the Earth's axis, but not the angle of its tilt relative to the ecliptic. Thus, precession affects the time of year in which various constellations are visible. The 23.4° axis tilt is constant, and so the seasons themselves continue just like they are now.</p>

            <p>The zodiac, traditionally, has served as an immense star chronometer in the heavens used to mark the passage of the Cosmic Ages.</p>
            <p>The period it takes for the equinoxes to precess through all 12 zodiac constellations was referred to by the ancients as a <span class=popup-link id=ppl-cosmicyear>Cosmic Year</span>, the period it takes to precess through each of them being a <span class=popup-link id=ppl-cosmicage>Cosmic Age</span>.</p>

            <p>Leo, Taurus, Aquarius and Scorpio roughly divide the <i>circle</i> of zodiac constellations into four equal sections.</p>
            <p>The brightest star in each of these four constellations, placed at approximately 90° from one another, were <span class=popup-link id=ppl-persia>traditionally</span> termed as <i>Royal Stars</i> or the <i>Guardians of the Sky</i>. They include</p>

            <h2>Shiny Machop</h2>
            <p>I like green shinies.</p>
            <p class=no-bottom-m>There is a chance of 1 in 8192 to get a shiny pokémon in SoulSilver. Today - 30th June, 2022 - I start to hunt for a shiny Machop in Mt. Mortar. I kill all the Machop I find and run from the rest of pokémon. I started using a level 18 Togepi with Paranormal and now, after 44 non-green Machops, it became a level 22 Togetic.</p>
            <!--<img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/javi-b/pokemon-resources/main/ani-shiny/machop.gif />-->
            <img src=imgs/machop.png />
            <p class=no-top-m>I will update any progress.</p>
            <p class=center>. . .</p>
            <p>It is day two - 1st July, 2022. Yesterday I ended up encountering 82 Machop, roughly 1% of 8192. Today I decided to make things a bit more interesting for myself.</p>
            <p>I haven't completed the game yet, I only have six gym badges so far and, originally, I was planning to not make any progress until I found a shiny Machop here in Mt. Mortar. However, I created a new rule for myself:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Until I find the shiny, for every 82 regular Machop I encounter (1%), I'm allowed to battle one new trainer in the game.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>I think this rule might help keep me motivated. Hopefully, I will find the green Machop before progressing too much in the game.</p>
            <p class=center>. . .</p>
            <p>By day three I have encountered 410 Machops (5% of 8192). My Togetic is level 44 now. Still, no luck with the shiny, as to be expected.</p>

            <p>...and it was a painful process that I don't recommend to anyone whose DSi works perfectly fine (as mine did).</p>
            <p>It does look good now, but the volume and L buttons don't click as they should. They are still usable but they don't feel right at all. Maybe it is my fault for ordering a cheap shell from AliExpress (15.80€), or maybe I messed up during the mounting process, or maybe I was just unlucky. I don't know.</p>

            <p>My advice.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>don't expect to finish quickly - expect spending the whole day, to be safe. (I thought I was gonna finish in a few hours and I ended up tired and not enjoying the process because it was getting late)</li>
                <li><a target=blank href=https://youtu.be/VV64hi33c-Y>this video</a> worked out well enough for me. the quality and camera angles are not perfect but the guy seems to know what he is doing and goes straight to the point</li>
                <li>take it as a learning process. it is going to be hard but you will learn a lot</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Maybe I'm exaggerating and this is super easy for you. I hope so :) Have fun!</p>

            <h2>I bought a MacBook 13' from 2010</h2>
            <p>I bought it on September 2022 and paid 240€ for it. <a target=blank href=https://everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook/specs/macbook-core-2-duo-2.4-white-13-polycarbonate-unibody-mid-2010-specs.html>Here</a> are the specs and original global prices (999€).</p>
            <img width=100% src=imgs/macbook2_500.jpg />
            <p>The previous owner made some improvements to the laptop. The memory has been buffed from 2 to 16GB and the hard drive is now a 500GB SSD. He also removed the DVD drive and used that space for the original 320GB hard drive, adding up to a total of 820GB of disk space (500GB being SSD). Lastly, he replaced the battery several times - the current one being new from last year.</p>
            <p>I'm very happy with the laptop, but there were some steps to be made in order to transform the device into something usable.</p>
            <p>The OS installed by default was Mac OS X Lion (10.7), but the latest supported is macOS High Sierra (10.13). Sadly, despite how beautiful I find old systems, Lion is not enough. Most software doesn't support it anymore and I can't even browse the modern web with its version of Safari.</p>
            <img width=100% src=imgs/macbook1_500.jpg />
            <p>The built-in software update program doesn't allow installing further updates, even though, according to Apple, the laptop is capable of running newer systems. Don't panic though, there is a magic secret method to get there:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Open <a target=blank href=https\://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211683>this link</a> using Lion's default Safari Browser.</li>
                <li>Download and install <b>OS X El Captian (10.11)</b>.</li>
                <li>Once El Captian is installed, open the link again and, this time, select <b>macOS High Sierra (10.13)</b>. This should open the App Store and allow you to install High Sierra from there.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class=border><b>Beware!</b> High Sierra is good enough for me in 2022, but it might not be for you! Some modern software is starting to not support it either, I had to download legacy versions for one or two programs. Do your own research for your specific needs.</p>
            <p>However - for media consumption and casual use<sup>1</sup> - I couldn't ask for more. The screen is good and bright, the speakers are loud, the keyboard and trackpad are among the best I've tried (it has a better keyboard than some newer MacBook out there...) and the CPU is fast enough if you are not multitasking to an extreme. If you like older hardware, the laptop's appearance could even be called somewhat cute. Last but not least, this is one of the lucky MacBook laptops using the impressively satisfying MagSafe power connector, which I recently discovered to enjoy very much.</p>
            <ol class=small-text>
                <li>Built-in macOS apps, Firefox and Safari for browsing, Transmission for torrents, Signal for messaging, YACReader for manga, GIMP for image manipulation, GitHub Desktop and some utility programs.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>I took a new interest in manga</h2>
            <p class="small-text off">This entry is hardly related to <u>I bought a MacBook 13' from 2010</u> (on the left), they just happen to share vertical space and they were written on the same day.</p>
            <p class="small-text off">Also, this site was not intended to become a personal blog and I'm sorry for that. But, to be fair, it was not intended to become anything at all, as its name - 什么也没有 - states.</p>
            <p>I think I had read just one manga before, and maybe I've watched around a dozen different anime in total. That first manga I read was <i>Girls' Last Tour</i> and I truly enjoyed it. I find it hard to describe, but if I tried I'd say -</p>
            <ol>
                <li>simple concept, but still creative</li>
                <li>beautiful art style and scenery</li>
                <li>a pure story and message</li>
            </ol>
            <p>-</p>
            <p>I've recently decided to resume my old habit of reading books - it's been going well - and, last week, I felt like reading manga as well. However, I came across some issues in the process.</p>
            <p class=center>. . .</p>
            <p>Soon I discovered that paying for the volumes is not a viable option. The price for buying a single digital volume from my country is around 8.50€, and 12.50€ for a physical one. The series I was looking into contain between 15 and 40 volumes. Some quick math can tell you that we are talking hundreds of euros for each series (digital!). I don't think it's worth it. Besides, volumes are not that long, I can read up to three or four in one day. Maybe in the future I will buy some physical manga, but, for now, I had to find an alternative.</p>
            <p class=center>Which I found.</p>
            <p>Maybe, and just maybe, I magically discovered a pretty interesting site that maybe could be called <i>nyaa [dot] si</i>. With that, the first issue had been solved.</p>
            <p>The second was finding good software for digital manga (cbz, cbr...), and the solution was YACReader. This wonderful piece of software doesn't only display your manga but allows you to create libraries from your folders with comic book files, showing all your volumes and your progress throught them. Besides, with the help of its mobile app, it can connect your libraries to other devices and download your volumes there as well. I do recommend it.</p>
            <p class=center>. . .</p>
            <p>So far I've been so much into <i>Dorohedoro</i>, I fell in love with its universe. Like <i>Girl's Last Tour</i>, I also find this manga a bit hard to describe (I think I'm just bad at it).</p>
            <p>Read it if you feel like some bizarre combination of<br>(1)post-apocalyptic, (2)cyberpunk and (3)magical fantasy.</p>
            <img width=100% src=imgs/dorohedoro.jpg />
            <p>My list of manga to read in the future includes <i>Tokyo Ghoul</i>, <i>Kokou no Hito</i> and <i>Attack on Titan</i>. But for now, I'm busy visiting the Hole and the sorcerers' world.</p>
